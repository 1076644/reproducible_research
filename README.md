# Reproducible research, Open code and Open data (ROO)

## Why reproducible research?

### Reproducible papers with live code

## FAIR and FAIREST principles

- **F**indable:
- **A**ccessible:
- **I**nteroperable:
- **R**eusable:

- **E**ngagement:
- **S**ocial connections:
- **T**rust:

## Best practices for code and data

- Keep it simple
- Annotate your code
- Use informative names for variables
- Use a code block structure

- Define a naming convention
- Use informative names for files
- Use lowercase in file names, avoid using spaces or special characters
- Use a versioning system in the file names
- Use conventional file formats

### Terminology

Before we get started with Git and GitHub, it is important to understand the following terms.
- **Repository**: a repository (or repo) is essentially a folder that contains all your files and their revision history.
- **Commit**: commits refer to changes in the repository files that have been recorded as part of its history. You can think of it as a snapshot of the repository at a given time.
- **Checkout**: checkouts allow you to switch between different versions of the repo. You can access a previous version of a file, commit or jump to a different branch.
- **Clone**: by cloning a repository with git you create an entire copy of that repository on your machine, including all files, commits and branches.
- **Pull**: you can pull the contents of the remote repository to update your cloned repo to the most recent version.
- **Push**: pushing allows you to update the remote repo with your local commits. However, it will only push commits from the current branch you have checked out.
- **Branch**: branching is a useful option when collaborating on code with others. It lets you work on an isolated copy of the repo, which you can then safely experiment with: any changes will not affect the main branch of the project.
- **Merge**: when you are convinced that the main branch can be updated with changes from a development branch, you can merge those changes into the main branch.
- **Fork**: a fork creates a copy of a repository on your GitHub account, which is independent of the original repo. 
- **Pull request**: you can send pull requests of any commits to the owner of a repo or to collaborators. If they approve the proposed changes, the commits can be merged into the main branch or repository.

We will be using GitHub website for the worked example, since it simplifies the git workflow and provides a graphical user interface (GUI).
